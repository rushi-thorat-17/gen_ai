# FILE: bedrock_rag.py
# PURPOSE: This file contains ALL the logic for:
#   1. Connecting to Amazon Bedrock
#   2. Sending a question to the Knowledge Base
#   3. Retrieving relevant document chunks (the "R" in RAG)
#   4. Getting the AI to generate a cited answer (the "G" in RAG)
#   5. Uploading documents to S3
#   6. Returning the answer + citations back to the Streamlit UI

# SECTION 1: IMPORTS
# ============================================================

import os       
# os = used to read environment variables
# Example: os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID") reads your key from .env

import logging  
# logging = prints structured messages to the terminal
# Better than print() because it shows timestamps and severity levels

import boto3    
# boto3 = official AWS SDK for Python
# This is how Python talks to AWS services like S3, Bedrock, EC2

from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
# ClientError = the specific error boto3 raises when AWS rejects a request
# Example causes: wrong permissions, wrong region, invalid parameters

from dotenv import load_dotenv
# load_dotenv = reads your .env file and loads the keys as environment variables
# Without this, boto3 cannot find your AWS credentials

from config import (
    AWS_REGION,         # "us-east-1" — which AWS data center to use
    KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID,  # the ID of your Bedrock Knowledge Base e.g. "ABCD1234EF"
    MODEL_ARN,          # the full ARN path to the Claude AI model
    NUMBER_OF_RESULTS,  # how many document chunks to retrieve per question
    S3_BUCKET_NAME,     # your S3 bucket name e.g. "my-company-knowledgebase-2024"
    S3_PREFIX           # folder inside bucket e.g. "documents/"
)


# ============================================================
# SECTION 2: INITIALIZATION
# Runs once when this file is imported by app.py
# ============================================================

# Load .env file so AWS credentials are available to boto3
# This must happen BEFORE any boto3 calls
load_dotenv()

# Set up the logger for this file
# logging.basicConfig sets the minimum level to show (INFO and above)
# INFO = normal messages, WARNING = something odd, ERROR = something failed
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Create a logger specifically named "bedrock_rag"
# So terminal messages look like: INFO:bedrock_rag:your message here
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# __name__ automatically becomes "bedrock_rag" (the filename without .py)


# ============================================================
# FUNCTION 1: get_bedrock_client()
# Creates a connection to Amazon Bedrock
# ============================================================

def get_bedrock_client():
    """
    Creates and returns a boto3 client for Amazon Bedrock Agent Runtime.

    WHY "bedrock-agent-runtime"?
    ─────────────────────────────
    AWS Bedrock has two separate services:
      • "bedrock"               → for listing/configuring models (not needed here)
      • "bedrock-agent-runtime" → for RUNNING queries using Knowledge Bases ✅

    HOW AUTHENTICATION WORKS:
    ─────────────────────────────
    boto3 automatically looks for credentials in this order:
      1. Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
         ← load_dotenv() above loads these from your .env file
      2. ~/.aws/credentials file (if you ran "aws configure")
      3. IAM Role attached to EC2 (used when deployed on AWS)

    Returns:
        boto3 client object ready to make Bedrock API calls
